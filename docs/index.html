# Service-oriented Architecture I

> A service-oriented architecture is a style of multitier computing that
helps organizations share logic and data among multiple applications
and usage modes.
-- Roy Schulte in 1996 [*]

# Service-oriented Architecture II

A set of components which can be invoked, and whose interface descriptions
can be published and discovered

> All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the
ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and
design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world.
No exceptions.
-- Jeff Bezos in 2002 [*]

Several ways how to describe these interfaces were created, but
Representational State Transfer (REST) has become the most popular.

# Development of Service-oriented Architecture

* SOA emerged in the 90's
* Became largely popular with the introduction of SOAP/XML in 2002
* Grew on complexity so much that many people stopped using this
term when talking about software archtecture

# SOA vs microservices
![SOA vs microservices](img/soa-google-search.png)

---

# Characteristics of SOA

* Entire application bundled together
  * Front-end, back-end, login service, etc.
  * Code base split into 'modules'
  * Soft bundaries are often broken after time
* Easy to develop, run and manage
  * ...until the application becomes too big
  * Difficult to maintain
* Any change to the source code results in a redeployment of the entire application

# Microservice-based Architecture (MSA)

> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.[*]
-- James Lewis and Martin Fowler
